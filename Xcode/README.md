# AudioKit Xcode Playgrounds

<table>
<tr>
<td>
There are over 100 playgrounds which cover basic tutorials, synthesis, physical modeling, file playback, MIDI, effects, filters, and analysis.

We have videos of most of the playgrounds in action, so you don't need to run Xcode to check them out, just go to [AudioKit Playground Videos](http://audiokit.io/playgrounds/).

To run the Xcode playgrounds, you need to use Cocoapds. Once you have CocoaPods installed,
run 

    > pod install

from the command line.  Then open the `AudioKitPlaygrounds.xcworkspace` file in Xcode and build (command-B).  Alternatively, you can download the `AudioKitPlaygrounds.zip` file from our [releases page](https://github.com/audiokit/AudioKit/releases).
